Gentle Mates Alpine won Major 1 RLCS after a 4-2 victory over G2 Stride in the Grand Final. The European team did not lose a single game throughout the tournament. They went 3-0 in the group stage and had two 4-3 victories in the playoffs. The wins over GenG and Karmine Corp were close but it allowed Gentle Mates Alpine a route to the Grand Finals. 
The Grand Finals themselves saw the team take a commanding 3-0 lead after victories on Mannfield, Forbidden Temple, and DFH Stadium. However, they lost the next two maps - Utopia and Aquadome. But it was on Neo Tokyo that they claimed tournament victory. With this victory, Gentle Mates Alpine took home $75,000 in prize money as well as added 40 RLCS points to their name. 
Epic had already unveiled details about Rocket League Major 2 earlier this week. The second Major will take place at the Copperbox Arena in London. The event will take place over four days starting on June 20 and ending on June 24. With the best teams in the world in competition, the second Major features a $255,000 prize pool with $75,000 going to the winner.
