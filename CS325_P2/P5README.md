# Project 5: Webpage Creation

## html.py
This python script loops through the folder of summary.txt to create an html page of the articles.
## all_news_articles.html
This is the html page made by html.py to be viewed
### Note:
I did not use an input.txt for the html creation since i used a path to the summary file
